## 🏗️ **What Was Fixed:**

The issue was that I had built a complete, TDD-tested game engine but hadn't properly integrated it into the Phaser scene system. I've now:

✅ **Connected All Systems**: City generator, physics, collision detection, etc.
✅ **Added Real Graphics**: Buildings render with colors and craters
✅ **Implemented Controls**: Keyboard input for angle/velocity
✅ **Created Game Loop**: Proper update cycle with physics simulation
✅ **Added Visual Feedback**: HUD, instructions, and game state display
